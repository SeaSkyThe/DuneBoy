# DuneBoy
A Gameboy Emulator written in OCaml

This is my first medium/big OCaml project, Im aiming to learn a little bit more than basic syntax and do a more "complex" project, to understand how a project organization would work.
And besides that, I also can reforce my knowledge about how a computer (even tho its a specific model) works.
